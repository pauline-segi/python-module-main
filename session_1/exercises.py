# Q1. This is the code for the first exercise, it works to cover all three examples in that exercise:

# first_number = input("Enter a number:")
# second_number = input("Enter a second number:")
# print(f"{int(first_number)+int(second_number)}")


# Q2. This is the code for the second exercise, it works to cover all three examples in that exercise:

# first_number = input("Enter a number:")
# second_number = input("Enter a second number:")
# print(f"{int(first_number)*int(second_number)}")


# Q3. This is the code for the third exercise:

# kilometers = input("How many kilometers?")
# print(f"Which is {int(kilometers)*1000} meters")
# print(f"And {int(kilometers)*100000} centimeters")


# kilometers = input("How many kilometers?")
# print(f"Which is {float(kilometers)*1000} meters")
# print(f"And {float(kilometers)*100000} centimeters")


# Q4. This is the code for the fourth exercise:

# your_name = input("What is your name?")
# your_height = input("What is your height?")
# print(f"{your_name} is {int(your_height)}cms tall")


# Q5. The input function:

# I feel it is an expression, but I'll google it to double check.
